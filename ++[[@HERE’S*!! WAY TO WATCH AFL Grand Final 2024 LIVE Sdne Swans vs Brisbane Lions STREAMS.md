What time is AFL Grand Final? Sydney Swans vs. Brisbane Lions live stream, TV channel for title match

The 2024 AFL season draws to a close today with the end-of-year Grand Final from the Melbourne Cricket Ground – although for the first time since 2006, neither side gunning to go all the way and win the Premiership is based out of the AFL's home city, as the Sydney Swans and Brisbane Lions arrive at the MCG just 80 minutes away from glory.

Sydney ended their regular-season on top of the AFL ladder, and have kept up their red-hot form in the Finals series, defeating GWS Giants and Port Adelaide Power last time out by 14.11 (95) points to 8.11 (59) in their bid for a first Premiership title since 2012.

The Brisbane Lions, meanwhile, are looking to go one better after losing last year's Grand Final to Collingwood, and have already played three times in the 2024 play-offs, beating Carlton, GWS, and Geelong last time out by 14.11 (95) points to 12.13 (85) to book their place in a second consecutive decider.

Triple premiership Tiger Jack Riewoldt says he’d be surprised if Joe Daniher retired if the Lions claimed the 2024 flag.

A bombshell report on Friday night sent shockwaves through the footy industry, with 7 News Melbourne reporting Daniher take stock of his professional career after the Lions’ Grand Final against the Sydney Swans.

Herald Sun reported Jon Ralph on Saturday morning declared the Daniher story was “real” and “not media speculation”, adding: “If Brisbane was to win this premiership, he’d be much more likely to call it quits.”

The Lions told Ralph that Daniher was indeed “considering the shape of his life after football with his family”, but stressed he was contracted until the end of 2025 and remained hopeful he’d play on.

“He’s due $1 million … but he’s never been defined by football, he’s certainly never been defined by money,” Ralph said.

Speaking on Fox Footy on Saturday, Riewoldt said the fact Daniher was mulling his future wasn’t surprising in terms of his reclusive nature. But the three-time premiership player suggested a Lions flag might only entice Daniher to play on.

“It doesn’t surprise me in terms of hearing what Joe Daniher’s character is about. He lives in Byron Bay and in the shadows a little bit and stays away (from the limelight). But you just wouldn’t want it leaking Grand Final week,” Riewoldt said.

“If the Lions win today and you get a taste of success, there is no way you’re retiring once you’ve gone to the top of the mountain because you just get this taste of what it’s like.

“The Lions aren’t going to be falling off the cliff any time soon, they’ve got a superstar team in all aspects of what they’re about. Once you win one, your mind goes straight to winning two.”

6AM – SWANS V LIONS PREVIEW

At the Swans (finished 1st, won QF vs GWS, won PF vs Port Adelaide), it’s about turning a minor premiership into a flag, as the last three teams to finish on top of the ladder did.

But it’s also about avoiding a growing Grand Final hoodoo. John Longmire became a premiership coach in his second season of 2012, but has lost all three Grand Finals since; two of them seeing his Swans be utterly uncompetitive.

The ghosts of 2022’s capitulation against Geelong will be fresh in the memory, with over half of Sydney’s 2024 Grand Final side playing in that loss. They cannot allow themselves to be haunted.

For the Lions (finished 5th, won EF vs Carlton, won SF vs GWS, won PF vs Geelong), it’s a unique tale of living up to expectations – but doing it the hard way.

Chris Fagan’s Brisbane has been the dominant team of this decade but does not have the premiership to prove it. Despite winning so many home and away games, this is only their second Grand Final appearance in this era of success.

The brutally narrow 2023 loss to Collingwood was not the reason for 2024’s slow start – a rash of ACL ruptures deserves more credit – but it didn’t exactly help, either. Still Fagan spearheaded a second-half surge (and was named Coach of the Year for it), recovering what looked like a lost campaign.akhauiaui

'The whole squad should get medals' | 00:34
Going undersold amid the Lions’ run to a second consecutive Grand Final is the fact they’re trying to become the second team this century to win the flag from outside the top four.

Sydney Swans vs. Brisbane Lions lineups, team news
A first AFL Finals campaign without the legendary Buddy Franklin hasn't harmed the Swans' scoring rate so far in 2024, with Joel Amartey and Tom Papley both notching three goals against Port Adelaide in the Preliminary Finals, and a sensational performance from Isaac Heeney also seeing him score twice at the SCG.

The Lions matched the Swans for both goals and behinds in their Preliminary Final win over Geelong, with Callum Ah Chee kicking three goals and Zac Bailey, Kai Lohmann and Hugh McCluggage all excelling as Brisbane made the Grand Final for the second year running.fdys
