# Getting started with LLM Compressor docs

```bash
cd docs
```

- Install the dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

- Clean the previous build (optional but recommended):

```bash
make clean
```

- Serve the docs:

```bash
make serve
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8000. You can now open your browser and view the documentation.
