# Saving a Model

The `llmcompressor` library extends Hugging Face's `save_pretrained` method with additional arguments to support model compression functionality. This document explains these extra arguments and how to use them effectively.

## How It Works

When you import `llmcompressor`, it automatically wraps the model's original `save_pretrained` method with an enhanced version that supports compression. This happens in two ways:

1. **Direct modification**: When you call `modify_save_pretrained(model)` directly
2. **Automatic wrapping**: When you call `oneshot(...)`, which wraps `save_pretrained` under the hood

This means that after applying compression with `oneshot`, your model's `save_pretrained` method is already enhanced with compression capabilities, and you can use the additional arguments described below.

## Additional Arguments

When saving your compressed models, you can use the following extra arguments with the `save_pretrained` method:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `quantization_format` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | Optional format string for quantization. If not provided, it will be inferred from the model. |
| `save_compressed` | `bool` | `True` | Controls whether to save the model in a compressed format. Set to `False` to save in the original frozen state. |

## Examples

### Applying Compression with oneshot

The simplest approach is to use `oneshot`, which handles both compression and wrapping `save_pretrained`:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from llmcompressor import oneshot
from llmcompressor.modifiers.gptq import GPTQModifier

# Load model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your-model")

# Apply compression - this also wraps save_pretrained
oneshot(
    model=model,
    recipe=[GPTQModifier(targets="Linear", scheme="W8A8", ignore=["lm_head"])],
    # Other oneshot parameters...
)

# Now you can use the enhanced save_pretrained
SAVE_DIR = "your-model-W8A8-compressed"
model.save_pretrained(
    SAVE_DIR,
    save_compressed=True  # Use the enhanced functionality
)
tokenizer.save_pretrained(SAVE_DIR)
```

## Notes

!!! warning
    Sparse compression (including 2of4 sparsity) is no longer supported by LLM Compressor due lack of hardware support and user interest. Please see https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/36799 for more information.

- When loading compressed models with `from_pretrained`, the compression format is automatically detected.
- To use compressed models with vLLM, simply load them as you would any model:
  ```python
  from vllm import LLM
  model = LLM("./your-model-compressed")
  ```
- Compression configurations are saved in the model's config file and are automatically applied when loading.

For more information about compression algorithms and formats, please refer to the documentation and examples in the llmcompressor repository.
