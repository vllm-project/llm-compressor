# LLM Compressor
`llmcompressor` is an easy-to-use library for optimizing models for deployment with `vllm`, including:

* Comprehensive set of quantization algorithms for weight-only and activation quantization
* Seamless integration with Hugging Face models and repositories
* `safetensors`-based file format compatible with `vllm`
* Large model support via `accelerate`

## Quick Tour
Let's quantize `TinyLlama` with 8 bit weights and activations using the `GPTQ` and `SmoothQuant` algorithms.

Note that the model can be swapped for a local or remote HF-compatible checkpoint and the `recipe` may be changed to target different quantization algorithms or formats.

### Apply Quantization
Quantization is applied by selecting an algorithm and calling the `oneshot` API.

```python
from llmcompressor.modifiers.quantization import GPTQModifier
from llmcompressor.modifiers.smoothquant import SmoothQuantModifier
from llmcompressor.transformers import oneshot

# Select quantization algorithm. In this case, we:
#   * apply SmoothQuant to make the activations easier to quantize
#   * quantize the weights to int8 with GPTQ (static per channel)
#   * quantize the activations to int8 (dynamic per token)
recipe = [
    SmoothQuantModifier(smoothing_strength=0.8),
    GPTQModifier(scheme="W8A8", targets="Linear", ignore=["lm_head"]),
]

# Apply quantization using the built in open_platypus dataset.
#   * See examples for demos showing how to pass a custom calibration set
oneshot(
    model="TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0",
    dataset="open_platypus",
    recipe=recipe,
    output_dir="TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-INT8",
    max_seq_length=2048,
    num_calibration_samples=512,
)
```

### Inference with vLLM

The checkpoints created by `llmcompressor` can be loaded and run in `vllm`:

Install:

```bash
pip install vllm
```

Run:

```python
from vllm import LLM
model = LLM("TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-INT8")
output = model.generate("My name is")
```
