    Run a layer-wise sequential data pipeline according to the following steps:

    1. Layers are identified according to `sequential_targets`
    2. A hook is attached to the first layer. This hook raises an exception which is
        then caught and used to capture the input arguments to the first layer
    3. The inputs to the first layer are used to calibrate the first layer, and the
        output of the previous layer is used as inputs to calibrate the next layer

    This pipeline requires that the model have distinct layers defined in its
    architecture and that the outputs of the previous layer are exactly the inputs
    to the next layer. This is violated by encoder-decoder architectures among others.

    If your model architecture violates these assumptions, consider using the sequential
    pipeline (see llmcompressor.pipelines.sequential). Architectures which are known to
    fail these assumptions include GPT-J and most vision language models
